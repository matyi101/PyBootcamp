Apache Hbase is a non-relational database that runs on top of HDFS. This schema-less database supports in-memory caching via block cache and bloom filters that provide near real-time access to large datasets, making it especially useful for sparse data which are common in many Big Data use cases. However, it is not a replacement for a relational database as it does not speak SQL, support cross record transactions or joins.
