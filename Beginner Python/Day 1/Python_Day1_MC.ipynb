    "\n",
    "**Open source.** The Python interpreter is open source software and managed by the non-profit Python Software Foundation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Readability.** Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "**High-level.** Python is a very high-level programming language. High-level programming languages have strong abstraction from the details of the computer. For example memory management has been taken care of. So in the code you will see commands that sound natural like english and the details under the hood of those commands are already being taken care of. Handy!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpreted.** Python is an interpreted language. It's means that Python code will not be compiled but each command will be translated into machine instructions and executed directly by the interpreter. This enables interactive computing as we will be doing in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Object Oriented.** Python is an Object Oriented Programming Language. It means that functionality is bundled together in objects and you can reason with those objects and let them interact.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamic typing.** Python has dynamic typing which means you don't have to declare the type of your variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Large standard library.** Python has a large and comprehensive standard library with lot's of functionality available right out of the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Large 3rd party libraries.** Python has a large collection of 3rd party libraries available as well. There are lot's of data science Python libraries that provide functionality for table operations, querying, visualisation, machine learning, data scraping and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Great for data science.** Python is easy to learn and very powerful. Python enables high productivity. It's has numerous data science libraries and a large supporting open source community."

A interpreter is a kernel that executes line by line and as opposed to a compiler that evaluates that whole program and then translates and executes the whole program at once. Python is an interpreted languages and has an Interpreter. "
